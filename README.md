# purescript-safe-money

_An experiment_ in trying to port parts of the Haskell library
[`safe-money`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/safe-money) and
trying to preserve some of the type level guarantees it provides -
which aren't provided by libraries like
[`purescript-money`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-money).
